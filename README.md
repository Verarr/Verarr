### Hi there, I'm VÃ©rarr ğŸ‘‹ ###

- ğŸ§’ I'm a child.
- ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on several projects and I'm still learning stuff.
- ğŸ‘¯ I don't think I'm ready to collaborate to anything **yet**...
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: **they/them** or any (I don't really care)
<!-- I thought I'd drop the 'Ã©'
- ğŸ’¬ My username could look like a real name to some people, but it's actually all made up. You can ignore the accented *e* and call me *Verarr* if you can't type *Ã©* easily.
-->
- ğŸ“« If - for whatever reason - you'd like to message me, you can send an email to my [listed email address](mailto:verarr.dev@gmail.com) or DM VÃ©rarr#0440 on Discord (if you can).
